    PRIVACY ACT NOTIFICATION STATEMENT FOR NCI OCR<br><br>\
    The web portal for the NCI OCR (Online Credentialing Repository) asks investigators to submit personal \
    information. The primary use of this application is as an online mechanism for submitting the Form FDA 1572 for investigator registration to the \
    National Cancer Institute. NCI OCR stores your information securely between submissions (i.e., subsequently you will only need to update what \
    changed since your submission), and allows you (appropriately authorized users) to apply a digital signature to the completed form. Collection \
    of this information is authorized under Section 405 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 284(b)(1) and Privacy Act System Notice \
    09-25-0200 (<a href="http://oma.od.nih.gov/ms/privacy/pa-files/0200.htm">http://oma.od.nih.gov/ms/privacy/pa-files/0200.htm</a>). This \
    information may be disclosed to researchers for research purposes, contractors responsible for the maintenance of the repository and to \
    other registered repository users for non-commercial, scientific and educational purposes. Submission of this information is voluntary, \
    but it is required for registration with the National Cancer Institute to conduct a clinical trial.<br><br>\
    The NCI OCR web portal also records IP addresses and aggregated user query information. However, the IP address is not associated with any \
    user registration information. The user registration data, IP addresses and aggregated user query information are used for NCI internal \
    reporting purposes only to allow for improvement of the NCI OCR web portal based on users needs. For additional information, please \
    refer to the link to our Privacy Policy <a href="http://www.nih.gov/about/privacy.htm">http://www.nih.gov/about/privacy.htm</a><br><br>\
    I have read this Privacy Act Notification Statement.\
